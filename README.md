[Image Puzzle](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-SAtwMdcWa-image-puzzle) is designed to create interactive image-based puzzles. It generates an image of an object using DALL-E, and then splits this image into a 3x3 grid, creating nine equal segments. Each segment is labeled with a number in the bottom-right corner. After splitting, the segments are shuffled and reassembled into a randomized configuration. The final result is a scrambled version of the original image, where the numbered segments appear out of order, inviting the user to solve the puzzle by arranging the segments correctly.

Users can interact with the puzzle by specifying numbers of segments they'd like to swap. The GPT will rearrange the segments accordingly, allowing users to progressively move pieces around until the image is correctly reassembled. This setup makes for an engaging and interactive experience, as users work step-by-step to reconstruct the original image by deciding which segments to exchange. The process encourages critical thinking and spatial awareness, and the custom GPT adds a playful element to image interaction by creating a hands-on visual puzzle-solving activity.
